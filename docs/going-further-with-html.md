Going Further
=============

That's all the documentation that exists so far for the HTML bindings. However,
other features exist and are demonstrated here:

https://html.alia.dev/

(Some of these demonstrations are very documentation-like.)

Keep in mind too that the full power of Emscripten is also at your disposal
when using alia/HTML.

And feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/alialib/alia-html/issues)
if you have any questions about it.
