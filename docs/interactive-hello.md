"Hello, World!"
===============

<script>
    init_alia_demos(['greeting-ui']);
</script>

Since alia is designed to write interactive applications, let's start with an
interactive version of the traditional 'Hello, World!':

[source](greeting.cpp ':include :fragment=greeting')

This example uses alia/HTML, which allows us to develop web apps in alia, so
you can see it in action right here:

<div class="demo-panel">
<div id="greeting-ui"></div>
</div>

?> We'll use alia/HTML a lot here so that we can demonstrate alia's core
   capabilities in your browser. For clarity, most of the examples make very
   explicit use of the namespaces `alia::` and `html::` to help illustrate
   what's part of the core of alia and what's alia/HTML.

If you're familiar with other declarative UI programming frameworks, it will be
obvious, but the key takeaway from this example is that when using alia,
application code is developed as **functions that operate on application state
and declare the presence of objects in the UI**.

These functions are designed to be reinvoked as the state changes. Each time
they're invoked, they declare what the application looks like **at that point
in time** and **for that particular application state**. In our example, every
time you type into the input box, the `name` state changes and `greeting_ui` is
reinvoked to decide what the new UI looks like. Every time, it decides to show
a message asking for your name and the input box that allows you to answer, and
sometimes it decides to show a greeting as well.

alia provides the mechanics to facilitate this style of development...
