Motivation
==========

The motivation for alia is perhaps best illustrated with an example. Imagine
that we're implementing a mapping application that has to display points of
interest to the user.

At first, our application is simple and our map isn't interactive, so our code
might start out something like the following. (In the interest of simplicity,
we're going to make liberal use of globals and gloss over some details...)

```cpp
void draw_map(rendering_context& ctx)
{
    draw_map_background(ctx);
    for (auto const& poi : points_of_interest)
    {
        // Draw a circle in the appropriate color for this type of POI.
        auto color = color_for_poi_type(poi.type);
        draw_circle(ctx, poi.location, color);
    }
}
```

This is classic immediate mode rendering. We'll simply call this function
whenever we need to draw (or redraw) our map, and our job is done!

And of course, we can easily refactor this:

```cpp
void draw_poi(rendering_context& ctx, point_of_interest const& poi)
{
    // Draw a circle in the appropriate color for this type of POI.
    auto color = color_for_poi_type(poi.type);
    draw_circle(ctx, poi.location, color);
}

void draw_map(rendering_context& ctx)
{
    draw_map_background(ctx);
    for (auto const& poi : points_of_interest)
        draw_poi(ctx, poi);
}
```

When our application behavior can be implemented as simple function calls, this
type of refactoring is easy, and it makes it straightforward to implement other
interesting behavior as well:

```cpp
void draw_map(rendering_context& ctx)
{
    draw_map_background(ctx);
    for (auto const& poi : points_of_interest)
    {
        // Do some filtering.
        if (poi_matches_user_interests(poi))
            draw_poi(ctx, poi);
    }
    // Dynamically add some other points that aren't in the list.
    if (location_tracking_enabled())
        draw_poi(ctx, get_user_location());
    draw_poi(ctx, get_user_home());
}
```

An important feature of this code is that calling `draw_poi` is essentially
declaring "This POI is part of our map right now." This allows us to use
familiar C++ control flow mechanisms like `if` and `for` to analyze our
application state and decide which POIs to include. Our map display
automatically updates according to that logic whenever the application state
changes.

In other words, this simple implementation of a map display is *declarative*!

Of course, immediate mode rendering only gets us so far. Now imagine that we
want the user to be able to interact with our POIs. Suppose we need to detect
when the user has clicked on a POI and open a popup with information about that
POI and some options for interacting with it. Suddenly, we need a richer
interface to our graphical POIs than `draw_poi` provides (i.e., a way to
deliver mouse events), along with some hidden state behind that interface
(e.g., is the popup open?).

All of this of course screams "POIs are objects!" And while an object is
clearly a good fit for these new requirements, naively introducing a list of
such objects into our application unfortunately breaks the declarative property
that we had before. For example, we can no longer use a simple `if` statement
to decide if the user's location should be part of the map. Instead, we'll need
to detect when location tracking has been enabled or disabled and add/remove
the corresponding object accordingly. Maybe we do this by listening for events,
or maybe we just write code like this now:

```cpp
void update_user_location()
{
    if (location_tracking_enabled() && !user_location_object_exists())
        add_user_location_object();
    else if (!location_tracking_enabled() && user_location_object_exists())
        remove_user_location_object();
}
```

Either way, this is more cumbersome and error-prone code than what we had
before, and we've started down a path where code complexity often scales very
poorly with application complexity.

alia is designed to bring back that declarative, 'immediate mode' style of
programming to your application code while still allowing you to interact with
objects under the hood. This library actually began life as an immediate mode
GUI library like [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), but in its
current form it has ditched the actual GUI code (which other libraries do
better anyway) in favor of focusing on the mechanics of managing objects and
events in a declarative/IM way.

alia provides the tools to allow our new interactive application to be written
like this:

```cpp
void do_map(app_context ctx)
{
    do_map_background(ctx);

    alia::for_each(ctx, points_of_interest,
        [&](auto ctx, auto poi)
        {
            alia_if (poi_matches_user_interests(poi))
            {
                do_poi(ctx, poi);
            }
            alia_end
        });

    alia_if (location_tracking_enabled())
    {
        do_poi(ctx, get_user_location());
    }
    alia_end

    do_poi(ctx, get_user_home());
}
```

We've replaced `draw_map` with `do_map`. Whereas `draw_map` was only concerned
with drawing, `do_map` is capable of handling mouse events as well.
Essentially, it decides what POIs are on the map (again, by calling `do_poi` on
them) and routes events to them (via the `ctx` parameter).

Somewhere inside `do_poi`, you might find code that detects what event is being
processed and either draws the POI or does some mouse logic. Importantly, each
call to `do_poi` can also store arbitrary data within `ctx`, which allows it to
maintain state about the user interaction or manage its own widgets. All of
this is invisible to `do_map`. (Except that `do_map` must be written with
special forms of `if` and `for`, which allow alia to ensure that each call to
`do_poi` is associated with the correct data.)

Effectively, each call to `do_poi` has the capabilities of a normal C++ object:
it can respond to multiple types of events, and it can maintain arbitrary
internal state. `do_poi` could even be a simple wrapper around a class.
However, unlike normal C++ objects, we don't have to explicitly create and
destroy calls to `do_poi`. Whatever calls are encountered during a call to
`do_map` uniquely specify the set of POIs that are present in the map. *do\_map
is declarative in the same way that draw\_map was!*

So, alia's goal is to allow you to write C++ application code declarative, even
when your applicationâ€™s functionality requires the power of objects, and even
when you want to utilize one or more libraries with an object-oriented
interface. The core of alia supplies the mechanics to make the above style of
programming possible, and it's intended to make the development of bindings to
other libraries fairly straightforward.
