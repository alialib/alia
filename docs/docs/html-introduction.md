Introduction
============

alia/HTML is a work-in-progress integration between alia and HTML5, allowing
you to develop client-side web apps in alia. It's built on top of
[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) and [the asm-dom
library](https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom). Many thanks to Matteo Basso for
helping to adapt asm-dom to work with alia.

alia/HTML has its own site where you can see some demos and example apps
implemented in it:
