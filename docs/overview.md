Organization of These Docs
--------------------------

Since alia is essentially a mini-paradigm within C++, documenting almost any
aspect of it requires explanation of the concepts involved. As such, there's no
clear separation between 'tutorial' and 'reference' documentation here. Some
parts are more reference-like than others, but everything is essentially in
'guide' form, which means there are some very dense 'guides' in here. The
sections (and the pages within them) are organized roughly from introductory to
advanced, so you could probably read things straight through, but once you've
read the "Introduction" section, feel free to jump around as you see fit.
